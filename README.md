Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Image Processing and Face Detection
 The system captures live images or video frames.
 Images are converted from BGR (Blue, Green, Red) format to RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format, which is used for processing.
 Facial detection algorithms, such as those powered by OpenCV and Dlib, scan the image to locate faces.
 White balance correction and skin-like region segmentation are applied to improve detection accuracy.

2. Face Encoding and Matching
 Detected faces are encoded using machine learning models.
 Facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) are extracted and analyzed.
 The system compares these encodings against a pre-stored database of registered faces.

3. Attendance Marking
 If a match is found, the system registers the personâ€™s attendance.
 The attendance data is logged in an Excel sheet or database for record-keeping.
 The timestamp of detection is also recorded.

4. Real-Time Identification
 The system can recognize multiple faces simultaneously.
 Webcam integration ensures real-time recognition and attendance marking.
 Neural network-based classification enhances the accuracy of identification.
